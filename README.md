### Stub

For giggles I took the [fasm elf injection stub](https://palaiologos.rocks/essays/posts/elf-infection/) from [kspalaiologos](https://github.com/kspalaiologos), and rewrote it in C, then added a function which badly checks if a binary is infected, and made a propergate function which will infect arbitrary binaries if it has permission to do so, as long as allowed by the aggressiveness value

### Selfmod

Last time I tried making a self modifing program I got shot down all over the place because of security measures and overly complex functions needed to make .text writable, this time I made a program which will inject a negated payload in a copy of its own elf which is stored as a mem_fd and execve it.

### Selfmod-ng

Basically the same concept as Selfmod but instead of storing the payload inside .data, the makefile instead dd's the negated payload into the payload function leaving padding for a condition which will make the negated payload not get executed(as that wouldn't work), and in the copy the codition will be removed and the payload will be found and negated.

### Libstdinhook

Inspired by a process hider library which overwrites the readddir dynamic libc function, this library hooks the read() function(which is used by 90% of all terminal password prompts) and dumps all buffer contents which are from stdin(fd 0), into HOOK_FILE

All you need to do is have it hidden somewhere and you can force it using either the LD_PRELOAD env var, which is practical for targeted login grabbing, or you can use /etc/ld.so.preload for a global stdin poisoning(this requires root), this does have one downside, LD_PRELOAD is ignored by suid binaries

### Libstdouthook

The exact same but for the write syscall capturing stdout and stderr

### Libprocesshider

More efficient and minimal implementation of the before mentioned processhider preload library
