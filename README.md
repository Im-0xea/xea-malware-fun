### Stub

For giggles I took the [fasm elf injection stub](https://palaiologos.rocks/essays/posts/elf-infection/) from [kspalaiologos](https://github.com/kspalaiologos), and rewrote it in C, then added a function which badly checks if a binary is infected, and made a propergate function which will infect arbitrary binaries if it has permission to do so, as long as allowed by the aggressiveness value

### Selfmod

Last time I tried making a self modifing program I got shot down all over the place because of security measures and overly complex functions needed to make .text writable, this time I made a program which will inject a negated payload in a copy of its own elf which is stored as a mem_fd and execve it.

### Selfmod-ng

Basically the same concept as Selfmod but instead of storing the payload inside .data, the makefile instead dd's the negated payload into the payload function leaving padding for a condition which will make the negated payload not get executed(as that wouldn't work), and in the copy the codition will be removed and the payload will be found and negated.
