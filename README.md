### Stub

For giggles I took the [fasm elf injection stub](https://palaiologos.rocks/essays/posts/elf-infection/) from [kspalaiologos](https://github.com/kspalaiologos), and rewrote it in C, then added a function which badly checks if a binary is infected, and made a propergate function which will infect arbitrary binaries if it has permission to do so, as long as allowed by the aggressiveness value

### Selfmod

Last time I tried making a self modifing program I got shot down all over the place because of security measures and overly complex functions needed to make .text writable, this time I made a program which will modify a function a function in a copy of its own elf and execve it.
